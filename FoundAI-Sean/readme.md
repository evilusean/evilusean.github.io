# FoundAI-Sean :
A repo for creating my new AI app : </br>
FoundAI-Sean : I got tired of writing a preamble for every query I sent to an AI specifying the format I wanted on a Japanese word. 
So I need an app that allows you to write the preamble, will be able to add it to the URL and save it as a URL-Parameters/QueryString, 
4 text boxes, one text box has the preamble prompt, the second text box has what you want to search, and the third text book allows you to copy it in full (preamble combined with the second box), 
also one that gives you the URL with the preamble to bookmark/save your query</br>
future sean problems : API integration to automatically add your updated query to an AI, URL Shortener for parameters (will need a backend for this) - 
since I am running this on github for free hosting I need a static site,  How many characters can the preamble be <2000? -
**Internet Explorer:** 2,083 characters total, with a maximum path length of 2,048. - **Google Chrome:** Around 32,767 characters.-
**Mozilla Firefox:** Around 65,536 characters.- **Safari:** Up to 80,000 characters. - </br>
The joke about about IE = What do you use IE for? To download Firefox.
