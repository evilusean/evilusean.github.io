I want to build an app for learning the unit circle and trig identities

- Will require 3 quiz modes, one for the angles/ratios on the unit circle and one for the trig identities, and one for SOHCAHTOA values

**Default Mode** : Have the unit circle with the special triangles ratios/angles (1/2, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, etc) for each angle with positive or negative, that can be changed from radians to degrees, you can fill in the blanks or be quizzed by highlighting a section of the unit circle, press 'space' to save to a list, 

**General/Manual Mode**: A randomized engine that generates **any acute angle ($1^\circ$ to $89^\circ$) and any side length**, utilizing $SOH CAH TOA$ for non-special ratios, supported by a **Degree/Radian Toggle** and a **Reference Angle Visualizer** for terminal sides in any quadrant.- 

**Deterministic Socratic Quiz Engine**: An interactive "Teacher Mode" that randomly populates a triangle with the bare minimum data required for a solution. It must utilize a **State-Based Scripting Tree** to guide the user through the specific "order of operations" for that unique triangle (e.g., if Side-Side is given, prompt for Pythagorean Theorem; if Angle-Side is given, prompt for Ratio Selection). 
- **Visual & Pedagogical Suite**: Include a **Dynamic SVG Canvas** that resizes the triangle based on real-world proportions and a **"Show Your Work" Logic Log** that prints the step-by-step geometric reasoning used.- 

**Trig Identities** Quiz mode : briefly display either a trig identity formula or a name like 'Sum of Sines' and then wait a few seconds, show it on screen, if the user presses 'Space' save it to a list the user can review after
