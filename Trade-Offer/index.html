    TODO: Get Image template for trade offer, add yes chad, if feeling ambitious add wo/soijacks, maybe gimp edit
    Might need to move <script> tag so it reads the JS variables from URL before rendering the template
    make it a url link so it can look something like this, and be mailable through email:
    evilusean.github.io/trade-offer/Give=Money&Take=WebDeveloper
    Maybe download button? Idk if that will work with a background image and 2 text divs, sendable link more convenient
    Can we use capital letters in URL? 'Give' 'Take'? can't test yet, 
    link to both portfolios
    <br> to add a new line, I wonder if the textarea will auto do this, will it post to URL? do we need a custom char?
    Ok, next hurdle, how do we get the <br> in a new line? do we need to add a script to add a line, and add <br> automatically?
    %20 = space
    %0A = newline
    Downloaded and installed VSCode extension 'serve', will allow me to test locally the code, github takes a while to update
    need to fix JS, URL variables aren't working, 'Trade-Offer' must be in caps?(I thought caps didn't matter for URLS)
    Decreasing size from 35 -> 30 for the TextDiv's made the placement worse, not better, increased to 40 still need to test.
      It's a little too high up in browser, might need to fix placement(again), future sean problem
      left side could also be moved to the right, will need to work on it again tommorrow, havn't even started JS/URL testing yet
