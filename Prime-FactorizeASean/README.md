# Prime Factorize A Sean

A basic static HTML website template for GitHub Pages.

## TODO :
Prime Factorize-A-Sean tree (show the prime factors for a number in a tree format using '/'  '\' for example : '18' '/9 and /3 \3' '\2' each making a triangle on a new line, until you can't factor anymore) - Also have the prime numbers floating on top like a screensaver, use a function with '%' modulo to check if something is a prime number - allow it to find the GCF using polynomials with mutliple terms - Finding Prime : enter a number and find the prime number for that position, like say if I wanted to find the 182nd prime number, go through sequentially until you find the 182nd prime number (3, 5, 7, etc...), can use this for Future Seans Passwords (Prime numbers can be good placeholders, so instead of writing a long ass @ssword down, it would be phrase-182 or email-182, and then when I read my password in notes, I know that I just need to find the 182nd prime number, but someone else wouldn't) - Also show branches of multiples for prime numbers up to '9' with '/' and '\' so you can see what their multiples look like when it's scrolling accross the top of screen and you click on that prime, every click expands it, (idk if you click once to find the multiple for 2, or just do 1-10 automatically, future Sean problem)
