<!-- Had an idea for a game where they chase the cursor, can use rapier for physics, when you can keep 50 alive on screen they all go to center
    and merge to the borg cube to 'win' - will need a custom mesh and custom cursor, with individual 'NPC's'
    use some of the previously built code to get it to work From 'RapierPhysicSean'
    Figure out a way to do 2D graphics - and raytracing/collision detection/Physics - Rapier is 3D - Might need another way  
    Maybe use another game engine? - This is a 2D game, I don't need threeJS for 3D, I just wanted the physics engine
    Check below for a list of resources:

    Also, games enemy is 'chad' who is trying to keep the spikes away from the NPC (a large head that changes direction like a planets orbits)
    but the NPC's win condition is to get vaxmaxxed while shouting platitudes like 'trust the $cience' 
    as the vaxmaxxing NPC get's more, he becomes slower, increasing game difficulty as the game progresses
