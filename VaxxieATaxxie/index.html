<!-- Had an idea for a game where they chase the cursor, can use rapier for physics, when you can keep 50 alive on screen they all go to center
    and merge to the borg cube to 'win' - will need a custom mesh and custom cursor, with individual 'NPC's'
    use some of the previously built code to get it to work From 'RapierPhysicSean'
    Figure out a way to do 2D graphics - and raytracing/collision detection/Physics - Rapier is 3D - Might need another way  
    Maybe use another game engine? - This is a 2D game, I don't need threeJS for 3D, I just wanted the physics engine
