    TODO: Get Image template for trade offer, add yes chad, if feeling ambitious add wo/soijacks, maybe gimp edit
    add a JS script that will count characters, and put text on left or right side image 
    increasing or decreasing character size for character count, 
    make it a url link so it can look something like this, and be mailable through email:
    evilusean.github.io/trade-offer/Give=Money&Take=WebDeveloper
    Maybe download button? Idk if that will work with a background image and 2 text divs, sendable link more convenient
    fix placement of text divs, need to figure out layout for text, and how to post it to URL variable
    maybe add color feature, to change text color, should take a few hours tops,
    link to both portfolios
