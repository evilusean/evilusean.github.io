    <!--TO DO:
    Sometimes, when you switch tabs and come back, the kanji starts dropping 2 at a time, and messses it up
    Fix the matrix trail to scale with the size of the character
    also fix the size of the red kanji dropped correct character, it also needs to scale, should be larger than original
    Sort by index feature or sort by amount of times wrong 

    Ironically, A 'Hide all buttons' button - I'm using it on a 15 year old imac with low res, and the top level is already getting pretty 'busy' 
        - or move the size/range notes to on hover effect if I want to reclaim some realestate - I haven't even tested on a phone device yet
    Maybe make it responsive - does it work on phones? do I need a drop down/hamburger menu for that to function? what about a high res horizontal screen? 
    Maybe add a speed mode? or toggle? 
    Maybe add a pause button?
    Just tested on phone - I should either make a drop down menu with options or make the one I currently have scrollable - it still works, somewhatish
        Needs a way to collapse buttons, take up half the screen, can't scroll through
        Needs a way to detect when phone is flipped from vertical to horizontal and respond accordingly
        The options currently take up half the screen, need to fix that, and you can't see half the options - works great on browser, not so much phone
        On smaller screens, hide all the lists, remove the notes(speed/range + speed number), remove the title - it should just be range + start + next + previous
        Maybe add a way to add to mobile phone 'My list' by double tapping screen - first need to fix responsive layout before adding features
        screen also turns off automatically after a few seconds, kind of counterproductive for a 'passive learning game'
        Maybe add a flip screen button? or auto toggle somehow, I've never done that before, so the user can just set their phone down and let the knowledge flow
    future Sean problem, add kunyomi and onyomi readings, right now I just want the kanji with english meaning so I can get the gist of whatever I read - K.I.S.S
