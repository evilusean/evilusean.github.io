A repo to store my new game for learning kanji meanings passively

Extracted all Kanji from this Anki Deck : Remembering_the_Kanji_1_6th_Edition_2200_Kanji.apkg </br>

I want future Sean to create another game that flashes the kanji on the screen briefly
 and then shows the answer after a brief delay, should be easy enough, and useful
 you should be able to select a range, 2200 kanji, learn 100-200, or 0-2200 for all,
 so if you want to learn 20 kanji a day, simply add your range of 1-20, 21-40, etc, etc, 
 and then to review all just add them all together like 1-200, for 10 days of review
 just set the range, play the game in the background, every time your consciousness glances over,
 try to remember what each kanji means, 20 a day seems pretty reasonable, stop when you know all the drops
Since there are no readings (multiple onyomi/kunyomi/etc/etc for each kanji) -  it is just the kanji and it's meaning, which is way easier to infer

Future Future Sean Problems : WaniKani has an API, you could use that to do whatever a user has learned on their platform
