    <!-- TODO: Just Tested, logic is different for Japanese, doesn't work will need to fix
     Removed the duplicate numbers, this is taking me 10x longer than slovak, and
     I'm still having issues, works well for 1-100 but need to fix logic for big numbers like 
     1,000 is 'issen' but it gets put down as 'ichi sen' and 
     800 is 'happyaku' but gets put down as 'hachi hyaku'
     it kind of defeats the purpose to practice big numbers - if it is doing it wrong
     now when it does duplicate numbers it will mess up the second part for example:
     33 = 'san ju san' with the new logic it is now 'san ju' - which is wrong, 
     I've avoided the duplicate number issue and brought in another problem, 
     shelving this for now, need to get back to slovak, so I can escape canada
     Add responsiveness, put 'min/max/step number' on same line for big screens seperate for small
     Add event listener for when enter is pressed, when cursor is in 'number' translate to slovak
        when cursor is in min/max/step go to next line when enter pressed
    Maybe add an ability to create a number list for review?        
     Add Time test(with a working CSS clock with hours/minutes analog vs digital)
     Add Month/Days of week tests to a new 'index.html' (total of 3? 4? apps)
     build the same above 4 apps for Japanese - still suck at Japanese numbers -->
